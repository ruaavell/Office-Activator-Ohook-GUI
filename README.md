This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) tool written in Python that uses the OHook method to **permanently activate** Microsoft Office 2016, 2019, 2021, 2024, and Microsoft 365 (most desktop/click-to-run versions).

OHook is an offline activation technique that installs a custom sppc.dll file inside the Office folder (it does NOT modify system files in Windows\System32). Once applied, activation survives Office repairs, updates, and even major Windows upgrades.

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT WARNINGS – READ BEFORE USING ⚠️

1. **You MUST temporarily disable your antivirus / Windows Defender** before running this program.
   Almost every antivirus (including Windows Defender, Avast, Kaspersky, Norton, Bitdefender, etc.) detects tools like this as:
   - HackTool
   - Crack
   - Keygen
   - Riskware
   - Trojan / PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application)

   → If antivirus is running, it will most likely **delete the .exe**, quarantine files, or even block the entire folder.

2. **Recommended safe steps**:
   - Go to Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Manage settings
   - Turn OFF **Real-time protection** (and preferably Controlled folder access too)
   - Add an exclusion for the folder where you extracted the program (if possible)
   - Run the program → Finish activation.

3. **Extract files to a simple folder** (do NOT run directly from ZIP)
   Recommended locations:
   - C:\OHook
   - Desktop\OfficeActivator
   - Any short path without special characters

4. **Requirements**:
   - Windows 8.1 / 10 / 11 (64-bit strongly recommended)
   - Microsoft Office already installed (2016 or newer – click-to-run / retail / volume)
   - Run the program **as Administrator**
   - Internet not strictly required (OHook is offline), but helpful for first-time checks

5. **Legal & Ethical Note**  
   This tool is **not officially supported or endorsed** by Microsoft.  
   The only 100% legal and recommended way to use Microsoft Office is with a genuine purchased license.

How to use (very simple):
1. Disable antivirus / real-time protection
2. Extract the program to a folder
3. Right-click the .exe → Run as administrator
4. Follow the on-screen buttons / instructions
5. Restart your computer after activation
6. Re-enable antivirus protection

Common issues & fixes:
- "DLL missing" or runtime errors → Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2015–2022 (x64)
- Activation fails → Make sure antivirus is fully disabled, not just paused
- Still blocked? → Temporarily uninstall third-party antivirus during the process

Enjoy activated Office 😄  
(but remember: supporting developers with a real license is always the best choice!)
